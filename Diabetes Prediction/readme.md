# Diabetes Prediction
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.<br>

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. The main objective is to predict whether the given person is having diabetes or not.<br>

The methods we intend to use are: Binary Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest Neighbour<br>

After performing various classification algorithms and taking into account their accuracies, we can conclude all the models had an accuracy ranging from 75% to 77%. Out of which <b>Binary Logistic Regression</b> gave a slightly better accuracy of <b>76.56%</b>

The project was performed using R programming language. <br>
