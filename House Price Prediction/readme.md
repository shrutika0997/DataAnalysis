# House Price Prediction
The dataset consists various parameters affecting the sales price of houses in King County, Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
The dataset cantains 20 house features plus the price, along with 21613 observations. <br>

The objective of this project is to perform data cleansing, and required transformations. The basic goal is to build a predictive model which will predict the prices of houses.<br>

After performing several algorithms we come to the conclusion that <b>XGBoost</b> is the best predictive model as its accuracy is highest (i.e. <b>89.95%</b>), highest variance score (i.e. <b>0.88</b>) which is very close to 1 and it took less training time w.r.t accuracy. Also it gives less RMSE score (i.e. <b>117546.89</b>) than other models.
