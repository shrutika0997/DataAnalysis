# Liver Disease Prediction
The given dataset is related to Indian patients who have been tested for a liver disease. Based on chemical compounds (bilrubin,albumin,protiens,alkaline phosphatase) present in human body and tests like SGOT, SGPT the outcome mentioned is whether person is a patient i.e, whether he needs to be diagnosed further or not.<br>

The objective of this project is to perform data cleansing, and required transformations and build a predictive model which will be able to predict most of the cases accurately. The basic goal is to classify whether the person is Liver Disease Patient or not.<br>

After performing various classification algorithms and taking into account their accuracies, we can conclude all the models had an accuracy ranging from 71% to 86%. Out of which <b>XGBoost Classification</b> gave a slightly better accuracy of <b>85.89</b>%
