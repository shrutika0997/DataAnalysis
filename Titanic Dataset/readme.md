# Prediction of Chances of Survival of Titanic Passengers

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the international community and lead to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck lead to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.<br>

The main objective of the dataset is to predict Chances of Survival based on several explanatory factors such as Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, etc. using Machine Learning algorithms.<br>

The methods we intend to use are:

* Binary Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

After performing various classification algorithms and taking into account their accuracies, we can conclude all the models had an accuracy ranging from 78% to 84%. Out of which <b>Decision Tree</b> gave a slightly better accuracy of <b>83.46%</b>.
